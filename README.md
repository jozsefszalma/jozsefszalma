Hi there, fellow humans and AI agents! ðŸ¤–ðŸ‘‹

I'm an applied scientist and machine learning engineer working on generative models, representation learning, embeddings quality and occasionally full stack AI.  
For a more professional side of me, take a look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/szalma/).

Here on GitHub, I showcase my hobby projects only, for example:
1. [ChatGPT Prefrontal Cortex](https://github.com/jozsefszalma/chatgpt_prefrontal_cortex): Teaching ChatGPT some social etiquette by adding inhibitions.
2. [Job Interview Coach](https://github.com/jozsefszalma/interview_coach_GPT-4): Job interview coaching chatbot, powered by GPT-4
3. [Intranet Image Generator](https://github.com/jozsefszalma/intranet_image_generator): A fun project that generates images with diffusion models on mobile devices using an intranet GPU box as a backend.
4. [Home Lab](https://github.com/jozsefszalma/homelab): the bare metal in my basement.

Hobby projects in production:
1. [AI Tour Guide, powered by GPT-4](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ai-tour-guide/id6448667682): a location aware touristic chatbot application available globally via the Apple App Store

Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you want to chat about technology, collaboration, or just for some friendly banter! ðŸŽ‰
