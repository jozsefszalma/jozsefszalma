## Project Highlights

- Built a NLP text embedding system capable of comparing products based on materials, colors and other product data with the capability to weight the importance of each input.
  - Tech stack: Databricks, Transformers, PySpark  

- Built a multi-modal search engine capable of mapping natural language search terms to product images
  - Tech stack: Databricks, Transformers, PySpark, BLIP-2 LLM, CLIP

- Innovated, trained and deployed a novel deep learning architecture (Multi-Path Asymmetric InfoVAE) capable of combining multiple embeddings into a single compressed representation.
  - Tech stack: Databricks, PyTorch
 
- Build an iOS mobile tour guide app, wrapping OpenAI's GPT-4, including an AWS backend REST API to handle API-proxying, purchasing, authentication.
  - Tech stack: iOS, Swift, AWS, Python

- Refactored and retrained a proprietary self-supervised visual embedding model;
  - migrated existing code from one cloud platform to another (e.g. by refactoring multi-GPU training in the new environment where PyTorch DDP was not natively supported),
  - improved training runtime performance 10x and decreased training cost by 10x (e.g. via local caching and code optimization to eliminate bottlenecks and deadlocks),
  - identified and remedied the root cause of certain model specific weaknesses.
  - Tech stack: Databricks, PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, Horovod, PySpark
 
- Built and trained a diffusion model, to generate fake product photographs from a list of materials and colors. The work included innovating novel methods to ensure the generated image showed the product from the desired viewing angle, without any additional objects or backgrounds being visible.
  - Tech stack: Databricks, PyTorch, Diffusers, PySpark
 
- Built, trained and deployed a conditional Generative Adversarial Network, to generate fake photographs from product sketches.
  - Tech stack: AWS, Databricks, PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, PySpark
 
- Built a machine learning visual-similarity pipeline and REST API for footwear visual recognition, capable of identifying shoe models down to article number from consumer-provided photographs.
  - Tech stack: AWS, TensorFlow, Keras
 
- Designed, built and deployed a global FIFO inventory management system, to track and report transfer pricing information.
  - Tech stack: SQL Server, SSIS data pipelines, SAP

- Designed and architected solutions, and provided consulting support during the development and deployment of three separate SAP HANA-based systems to automate global processes.
  - Tech stack: SAP, SAP-HANA
 
- Designed, built and deployed a data mining and dashboarding solution that cut 1 working day from month-end consolidation processes.
  - Tech stack: SQL, JavaScript, Db2, Hyperion BI
