## Project Highlights

- Built a NLP text embedding system capable of comparing products based on materials, colors and other product data with the capability to weight the importance of each input.
  - Tech stack: Databricks, Transformers, PySpark  

- Built a multi-modal search engine capable of mapping natural language search terms to product images
  - Tech stack: Databricks, Transformers, PySpark, BLIP-2 LLM, CLIP

- Innovated, trained and deployed a novel deep learning architecture (Multi-Path Asymmetric InfoVAE) capable of combining multiple embeddings into a single compressed representation.
  - Tech stack: Databricks, PyTorch
 
- Build an iOS mobile tour guide app, wrapping OpenAI's GPT-4, including an AWS backend REST API to handle API-proxying, purchasing, authentication.
  - Tech stack: iOS, Swift, AWS, Python

- Refactored and retrained a proprietary self-supervised visual embedding model;
  - migrated existing code from one cloud platform to another (e.g. by refactoring multi-GPU training in the new environment where PyTorch DDP was not natively supported),
  - improved training runtime performance 10x and decreased training cost by 10x (e.g. via local caching and code optimization to eliminate bottlenecks and deadlocks),
  - identified and remedied the root cause of certain model specific weaknesses.
  - Tech stack: Databricks, PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, Horovod, PySpark
 
- Built and trained a diffusion model, to generate fake product photographs from a list of materials and colors.
  - Tech stack: Databricks, PyTorch, Diffusers, PySpark
 
- Built, trained and deployed a conditional Generative Adversarial Network, to generate fake photographs from product sketches.
  - Tech stack: AWS, Databricks, PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, PySpark
 
- Built a machine learning visual-similarity pipeline and REST API for footwear visual recognition, capable of identifying shoe models down to article number from consumer-provided photographs.
  - Tech stack: AWS, TensorFlow, Keras
 
- Designed, built and deployed a global FIFO inventory management system, to track and report transfer pricing information.
  - Tech stack: SQL Server, SSIS data pipelines, SAP

- Designed and architected solutions, and provided consulting support during the development and deployment of three separate SAP HANA-based systems to automate global processes.
  - Tech stack: SAP, SAP-HANA
