  - Tech stack: Databricks, PyTorch
 
- Build an iOS mobile tourguide app, wrapping OpenAI's GPT-4, including an AWS backend REST API to handle API-proxying, purchasing, authentication
  - Tech stack: iOS, Swift, AWS, Python

- Full refactor and full retraining of a proprietary self-supervised visual embedding model
  - migrated existing code from one cloud platform to another (e.g. by refactoring multi-GPU training in the new environment where PyTorch DDP was not natively supported)
  - improved training runtime performance 10x and decreased training cost by 10x (e.g. via local caching and code optimisation)
  - identified and remedied the root cause of certain model specific weaknesses
  - Tech stack: Databricks, PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, Horovod, PySpark
 
- Built and trained a diffusion model, to generate fake photographs from a list of materials and colors
  - Tech stack: Databricks, PyTorch, Diffusers, PySpark
 
- Built, trained and deployed a conditional Generative Adversarial Network, to generate fake photographs from product sketches
  - Tech stack: AWS, Databricks, PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, PySpark
 
- Built a machine learning visual-similarity pipeline and REST API for footwear visual recognition, capable of identifying shoe models down to article number from consumer-provided photographs
  - Tech stack: AWS, TensorFlow, Keras
 
- Designed, built and deployed a global FIFO inventory management system, to track transfer pricing information
  - Tech stack: SQL Server, SSIS data pipelines, SAP
 
- Designed, built and deployed a data mining and dashboarding solution that cut 1 working day from month-end consolidation processes
